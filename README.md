# COWBOY BEBOP QUIZ

Thanks for checking out my short Cowboy Bebop quiz! With the upcoming live action, I thought it would be fun to do a quiz about my FAVORITE anime! I can remember staying up late to watch toonami, and see my favorite characters light up the television! Enjoy! 
## Lessons Learned

Wow, this was a tough one. I'm still struggling with the syntax of javascript, but I feel that the more I practice it, the better I become. Everything's a variable, everything can change something, everything can break your code! But the "Ah Ha!"
 moment is something that has me hooked on javascript. Getting the questions to appear on my page was that such feeling.
